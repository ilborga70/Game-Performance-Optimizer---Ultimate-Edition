## 🚀 Portable Usage

### **System Requirements**
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- .NET Framework 4.8 (usually pre-installed on Windows 10/11)
- **Administrator privileges required for full functionality**

### **Running the Application**

### **⚠️ Security Note for Portable Executable**
Since this is an unsigned portable application, Windows SmartScreen may show a warning. This is normal for community-developed tools:

- Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"** 
- The application is completely safe and only modifies standard Windows gaming optimizations
- All changes are reversible through the application itself

### **Portability Benefits**
- **Carry on USB**: Use the same optimized settings on multiple PCs
- **Game LAN Ready**: Perfect for gaming tournaments and LAN parties
- **No Installation Conflicts**: Safe to use alongside other gaming software
- **Instant Cleanup**: Simply delete the .exe to remove the tool completely

## 🛠️ Optimization Guide

### **Quick Start (5-Minute Setup)**
1. **Launch** the portable executable as Administrator
2. **Tab 1**: Select your main game .exe → "Exclude Indexing"
3. **Tab 2**: Select same game → "Set High Priority" + "Disable FSO"
4. **Tab 3**: "Clear DirectX Cache" + "Force High Performance"
5. **Tab 4**: "Apply Network Optimizations" → Restart when prompted

### **Advanced Optimization**
1. **Disk & Indexing Tab**: Exclude all frequently played game directories
2. **CPU & Priority Tab**: Set competitive games to High Priority, casual games to Normal
3. **Cache & Power Tab**: Monthly cache maintenance routine
4. **Network Tab**: Apply before competitive gaming sessions

### **Maintenance Schedule**
- **Weekly**: Clear DX Cache + Check power plan
- **Monthly**: Clear all GPU caches + Verify network settings
- **After Driver Updates**: Clear all caches in Tab 3
